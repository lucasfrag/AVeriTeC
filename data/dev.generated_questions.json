But both mandates explicitly exempt houses of worship from the misdemeanor penalty for violators.\n\n\"That\u2019s an area we don\u2019t have the ability to directly enforce or control,\" Whitmer said during an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nDemocratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly tightened restrictions on mass gatherings in her state to no more than 10 people. But much like with Michigan, she exempted houses of worship as long as congregants engage in appropriate social distancing. Ohio officials carved out exemptions for religious gatherings, including weddings and funerals, from its stay-at-home order, on top of a broad exemption for any gathering \"for the purpose of the expression of First Amendment protected speech.\" And this week, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Luhan Grisham (D) imposed a ban on gatherings of five or more that excludes those \"congregated in a church, synagogue, mosque, or other place of worship.\"",
